# FHIRKit Client

This is a fork of [Vermonster/fhir-kit-client](https://github.com/Vermonster/fhir-kit-client) with some modifications:

 - This is NodeJS only.
 - This uses `got` instead of `fetch` and NodeJS polyfills.
 - The parameters are more strictly validated.
 - The dependencies are a bit more recent.
 - It has more eslint rules.
